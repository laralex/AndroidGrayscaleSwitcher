        The application currently doesn\'t have a permission to write secure settings,
        in particular we need \"Simulate color space\" option in \"Developer options\"
    </string>
    <string name="permission_tip_solution">
        A solution is to turn on \"Developer options\" on your phone (Google how)
        and to give the app the aforementioned permission by either:\n
        — unlocking ROOT rights or\n
        — connecting via USB to a PC which has ADB tool and executing in a terminal:

        adb shell pm grant com.laralex.grayswitcher android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS
    </string>
    <string name="adb_command_copied">ADB command was copied</string>
    <string name="permission_tip_guarantees">
        If you\'re worried of giving such permission to us,
        check out our open source code, which proofs,
        that we DO NOT do any stuff on your phone except for switching of the grayscale setting
